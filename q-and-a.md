# Q&A

## What is the difference between Hyron and other frameworks ?

**Short** : `Simplicity`, and always will be

**Long** : We are working hard to build a more powerful framework. How to save the most effort of programmers in the process of working. We focus on bringing a better solution, with many outstanding points. Here are some of Hyron strengths

1. **Extremely flexible**, you can customize, expand hyron by building an addons, or build plugins to handle I/O
2. **High packaging capacity**, clear architecture with easy-to-customize and interactive interfaces allow you to use them flexibly for a variety of situations

4. **Easy to use**, even for beginners. The interface of the hyron is designed to be minimal, from the router to the active stream
5. **Centralized package management**, enabling you to capture the entire application, especially for medium and large-scale projects
6. **Easy to reuse**, allowing you to save maximum effort in the development process, thanks to the encapsulation and accompanying ecosystem
7. **Not only for NodeJS**, Hyron can improve and develop independently to bring the highest performance without affecting the source code, can support multiple languages later.
8. **High performance**, thanks to meticulous optimization efforts, hyron was able to achieve top \#2 performance in frameworks, just behind fastify

## Which type of application is Hyron suitable for ?

Hyron is designed to develop applications with medium and large scale, with the ability to develop and expand high, needing flexible development.
