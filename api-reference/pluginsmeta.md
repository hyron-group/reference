Contain parts of a plugins. It helps separate the layer and handle input and output separately from the logical processing layer, making it easy to reuse them for many different situations.



### var fontware

```javascript
fontware : Middleware
```

This part will be **called before executer** for each time request has make. That could be used to handle input data such as prepare params for executer, handing connect, rate limited, decode, authenticate or something else



### var backware

```javascript
backware : Middleware
```

This part will **be called after executer** for each time request has make. That could be used to handle output data such as analysis, encode, authenticate or something else
