# Create Application

## Usage

### 1. Initialization application

{% code-tabs %}
{% code-tabs-item title="Using hyron-cli" %}
```bash
hyron init app
```
{% endcode-tabs-item %}
{% endcode-tabs %}

{% code-tabs %}
{% code-tabs-item title="Structure" %}
```text
app-name
  ├── addons/         - contains the addons of your application
  ├── docs/           - contains project-related documents
  ├── lib/            - contains reusable libraries
  ├── plugins/        - contains the plugins of your application
  ├── public/         - contains resources that are publicly accessible
  ├── server/         - contains descriptions of instances that can be used by Hyron to run the application
  ├── services/       - contains the services of your application
  ├── strings/        - contains the string values in the application that can be used by @hyron/stringer plugins
  ├── test/           - contains test suites for the application
  ├── .gitignore      - contains the setting of git to ignore when synchronizing source code
  ├── appcfg.yaml     - contains application-level application configs
  ├── package.json    - contains descriptions of the application that can be used by npm
  └── readme.md       - contains descriptive information about the project
```
{% endcode-tabs-item %}
{% endcode-tabs %}

### 2. Create Modules

Hyron app based on 3 module units

1. **Services :** are the smallest processing units for a business logic. For more information, please see [Create Services](create-services.md) topic
2. **Plugins** : are the middleware from I/O layer, used to handle incoming, outgoing or interactive flows, and use it flexibly for many situations. For more information, please see [Create Plugins ](create-services.md)topic
3. **Addons** : are pluggable functions for customizing, or adding features to the hyron, interacting with resources that Hyron manages, and other situations. For more information, please see [Create Addons](create-addons.md) topic

{% hint style="info" %}
Tips : Hyron developed many features that allow you to reuse it to the maximum. Design your modules the most flexible way to use them for your later projects
{% endhint %}

### 3. Create instance

An **instance is a case of the application**. Hyron allows you to separate applications into separate instances, making it easier for you to manage

instances should be declared in a [json build file](json-build-file.md) using json syntax

instances can overlap each other, the hyron will pool them at runtime. It is used to group instances according to the corresponding addons or as required by the project

{% code-tabs %}
{% code-tabs-item title="server/app.js" %}
```scheme
{
    "base_url": "http://localhost:3000",
    "addons": {
        "db-setup" : "addons/database-setup",
        "multi-language": "@hyron/multi-pl",
        "java-driver" : "addons/java-driver",
        "python-driver" : "addons/python-driver"
    },
    "plugins": {
        "auth" : "plugins/simple-auth",
        "stringer": "@hyron/stringer",
        "validator": "@hyron/validator"
    },
    "services": {
        "account": "services/account/router.js",
        "user": "services/user/router.js",
    }
}
```
{% endcode-tabs-item %}
{% endcode-tabs %}

### 4. Run your app

You can use hyron-cli to run the application

```text
hyron start
```
