-   **Free programmers**, who want start a MVP server app
-   Those companies that **outsource**, have high demand for code reuse and assembly
-   **New programmers** start with NodeJS

# Why should i choice Hyron for my app ?

-   **I'm new** NodeJS programmer, and have not much knowledge about application development
-   I want my application to be **high performance**, easy to **grow** and **expand**
-   I want to develop my application using **Micro-Service Architecture**
-   I want my code to have the highest **reusability** possible even for different projects

# Strategic Vision

-   **Top \#1 Framework** for server side application development
-   **Fast**, **Convenient**, **Efficient**, **Flexible**, better serving large enterprise applications
