We are upgrading the document to make it more accessible to everyone. We are looking forward to receiving suggestions from you to build better materials and products

Hyron focus to 5 main `values`. that's what makes Hyron different

![Values of Hyron Framework](.gitbook/assets/hyron-strength%20%281%29.png)

1. **High Reusability** : Hyron allows to pack modules easily, allowing you to better reuse, or you can share and use packages from the community.
2. **Easy to Expand** : Hyron aims to serve to develop complex applications, used for businesses, requiring high development and expansion capabilities. Make work easier and easier
3. **Easy to Use** : briefly, hyron brings `simplicity`. The leading principle in design and development must ensure that it will be simpler than the existing one. To be easy to use even with new programmers
4. **High plug-in capability** : Hyron aims to maximize automation of the development process, to help save effort. An instance of it is the ability to plug in easily with the JSON build file
5. **Easy to Expand** : You can customize it through plugging in an addons, which allows you to interact with the resources managed by Hyron.

## Vision

![What if the community can help each other more effectively ?](.gitbook/assets/cc-graphic.png)

Hyron aims to develop an ecosystem, to help developers develop products more **efficiently** and **easily**. By maximizing effort, through maximum **automation** and **reuse**, improving **workflows**, leveraging the power of the developer **community** from around the world.

![Do you believe that a junior programmer can build a complex project ?](.gitbook/assets/73ea288207e8d120e20bc02dca78719e_xl.jpg)

We are working hard to make Hyron better and better. We hope that we can turn Hyron into a **top framework**, and not just stop at NodeJS. Hyron will soon evolve to support multilingual and microservice support to develop **large and complex projects** easier and more efficient.
