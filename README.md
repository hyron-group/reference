# Overview

We are upgrading the document to make it more accessible to everyone. We are looking forward to receiving suggestions from you to build better materials and products

## Problems

1. **Limited re-use**, many modules from around the world are created, but it's difficult to use them for new projects.
2. **Complex technology**, to develop a complete project needs a lot of skills and experience. It would be difficult for a beginner or a junior to develop a good product that meets quality, is easy to develop and maintain
3. **Cost time**. Do you realize that you often have to repeat boring tasks, or take too much time to set up. Things you wonder if they can automate?
4. **Multilingual problem**. To develop a business application will require you to use a variety of technologies to solve the problem. And each of those technologies requires you or your team to have certain skills to deploy with microservices. And how to manage them effectively?

## Solutions

Hyron focus to 5 main `values`. that's what makes Hyron different

1. **High Reusability** : Hyron allows to pack modules easily, allowing you to better reuse, or you can share and use packages from the community.
2. **Easy to Expand** : Hyron aims to serve to develop complex applications, used for businesses, requiring high development and expansion capabilities. Make work easier and easier
3. **Easy to Use** : briefly, hyron brings `simplicity`. The leading principle in design and development must ensure that it will be simpler than the existing one. To be easy to use even with new programmers
4. **High plug-in capability** : Hyron aims to maximize automation of the development process, to help save effort. An instance of it is the ability to plug in easily with the JSON build file
5. **Easy to Expand** : You can customize it through plugging in an addons, which allows you to interact with the resources managed by Hyron

Hyron is still in the first stage. We hope that we can create products that help programmers work more easily. We need help from you to do that. Checkout [how to contribute](contribute.md) topic

## Vision

![Unity is Strength](.gitbook/assets/cc-graphic.png)

Hyron aims to develop an ecosystem, to help developers develop products more **efficiently** and **easily**. By maximizing effort, through maximum **automation** and **reuse**, improving **workflows**, leveraging the power of the developer **community** from around the world.

![What if building a big project is as simple as playing a puzzle ?](.gitbook/assets/73ea288207e8d120e20bc02dca78719e_xl.jpg)

We are working hard to make Hyron better and better. We hope that we can turn Hyron into a **top framework**, and not just stop at NodeJS. Hyron will soon evolve to support multilingual and microservice support to develop **large and complex projects** easier and more efficient.
