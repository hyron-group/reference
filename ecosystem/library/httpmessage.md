## Details

### 1. Break processing with thow

This is a interested feature of Hyron buildin lib, that allow you break the flow of hyron processing using a throw, or a Promise reject. Such as throw a normal Error

It could be used at every where. But, you need to remember that you need to require 'hyron' first.

Example :

```javascript
// main-handler
class User {
    ...
    async findUser(name) {
        // mongoose
        var userData = await UserModel.findOne(name).exec();
        if(userData==null) {
            // That it
            throw new HTTPMessage(
                StatusCode.NOT_FOUND, 
                "not found user with name : "+name);
        }

        return userData;
    }
}
```

### 2. Human readable status code

With StatusCode - a class mapping http code with a readable name, you can easy to choise a code fit you case. Bellow is a code mapping for http
